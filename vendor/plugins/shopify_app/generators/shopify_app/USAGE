Description:
    This is a generator for creating a basic Shopify application to quickly get
    you started. You can see some examples on how to use the Shopify API.
    
    The generator creates a basic login controller for authenticating with your
    Shop and a controller called "dashboard" which displays basic information 
    about your products, orders and articles.
    
    Note: It's recommended to use this on a new Rails project, so that the 
          generator won't overwrite/delete some of your files.

Usage:
    Pass your API key and then your Secret, which the login controller 
    will need to authenticate with your shop.
    If you don't have an API key yet, register your application at:
    
    <YourShopURL>/admin/api 
      (e.g. "http://shopname.myshopify.com/admin/api")

    
Examples:
    script/generate shopify_app edffbb1bb793e2750686e6f4647a384a abbcee050...
        
        Will create a login controller and a dashboard controller with their
        own views.
