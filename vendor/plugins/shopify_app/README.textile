h2. Shopify application generator

h3. Description:

This is a generator for creating a basic Shopify application to quickly get
you started. You can see some examples on how to use the Shopify API.
    
The generator creates a basic login controller for authenticating with your
Shop and a controller called "dashboard" which displays basic information 
about your products, orders and articles.
    
bq. _Note:_ It's recommended to use this on a new Rails project, so that the 
generator won't overwrite/delete some of your files.

h3. Installation:

a) If you have Git installed and run a fairly new version of Rails, use:

bq. @script/plugin install git://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app@

b) If you don't have Git installed (although you should, because it will propably be the new standard):

bq. Download this project using the download link above, and extract it into your @vendor/plugins@ directory

h3. Usage:

Pass your API key and then your Secret, which the login controller 
will need to authenticate with your shop.

If you don't have an API key yet, register your application at: "YourShopURL/admin/api":#

(e.g. "http://yourshopname.myshopify.com/admin/api":#)

    
h3. Example:

@script/generate shopify_app edffbb1bb793e2750686e6f4647a384a fed5bb18hde3e2750686e6f4647a781a@
        
This will create a login controller and a dashboard controller with their own views.

h3. After running the generator:

# Run your application with @script/server@
# And visit "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000 to see what has been created
